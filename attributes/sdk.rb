  # The version attribute is optional. If a version number is provided, then the
  # offering will be installed or uninstalled at the version level specified as
  # long as it is available in the repositories. If the version attribute is not
  # provided, then the default behavior is to install or uninstall the latest
  # version available in the repositories. The version number can be found in
  # the repository.xml file in the repositories.
  #
  # NOTE: In some cases, a package might be rolled back to an earlier version.
  # This roll back can happen if the version specified is earlier than the
  # installed version or if a version is not specified. For example, you have
  # version 1.0.2 of a package that is installed and the latest version of the
  # package available in the repository is version 1.0.1. When you install the
  # package, the installed version of the package is rolled back to version
  # 1.0.1.

  # The features attribute is optional. Offerings always have at least one
  # feature; a required core feature which is installed regardless of whether
  # it is explicitly specified. If other feature names are provided, then only
  # those features will be installed. Features must be comma delimited without
  # spaces.

  #   none        = Do not install available fixes.
  #   recommended = Installs all available recommended fixes.
  #   all         = Installs all available fixes.
